Chromerow
=========

A chrome extension to enable keyboard-based navigation within web pages. Use the `hjkl` keys to jump through the page:

- **h**: Nearest link or text input to the left
- **j**: Nearest link or text input below
- **k**: Nearest link or text input above
- **l**: Nearest link or text input to the right

This minimizes your time away from the home row of the keyboard, optimizing efficiency.
